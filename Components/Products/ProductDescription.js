              Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are the backbone of
              many organizations, helping them manage their accounting,
              procurement processes, projects, and more throughout the
              enterprise. For many IT departments, ERP systems have often meant
              large, costly, and time-consuming deployments that might require
              significant hardware or infrastructure investments. The advent of
              cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) deployments are
              at the forefront of a change in the way businesses think about
              ERP. Moving ERP to the cloud allows businesses to simplify their
              technology requirements and see a faster return on their
              investment.

              Cloud ERP solutions are mature offerings that have all the same
              features and functionality as their on-premises counterparts. In
              addition, the cloud deployment model easily enables the
              integration of other key technologies, such as mobility, decision
              support systems, and collaboration and social systems. Cloud
              services are growing in popularity among leading businesses that
              want applications with modern functionality, but without the
              overhead of IT infrastructure, maintenance, and upgrades. To
              ensure the success of your SaaS ERP system, you can leverage
              integrated suites and cloud platforms with industry-leading high
              performance and scalability, unparalleled reliability, and
              improved security.

              Software as a Service (SaaS) allows users to subscribe to and use
              application software in the cloud rather than having to buy the
              hardware or license the software. You simply purchase this
              software from a cloud provider for a monthly subscription fee and
              the service is delivered to you over the internet. A modern cloud
              suite provides complete software for your entire business so that
              you can subscribe to certain SaaS applications for your finance,
              supply chain, human resources, customer experience, sales, and
              marketing organizations.
