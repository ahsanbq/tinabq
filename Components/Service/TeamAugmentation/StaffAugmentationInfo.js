          Team augmentation is an effective outsourcing strategy that allows
          businesses to enhance their teams with skilled tech professionals as
          needed. Whether you're a product development company seeking global
          tech talent or a startup aiming to rapidly increase your teamâ€™s
          capabilities, team augmentation offers a streamlined solution without
          the complexities of hiring and onboarding full-time employees.
